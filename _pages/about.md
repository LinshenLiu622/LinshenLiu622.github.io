I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), under the supervision of Prof. [Hao (Frank) Yang](https://www.haofrankyang.net/). I recieved [Joseph Meyerhoff Fellowship](/https://engineering.jhu.edu/education/graduate-studies/full-time-graduate-fellowships-grants/) (https://engineering.jhu.edu/education/graduate-studies/full-time-graduate-fellowships-grants/) (Awarded to one of the top first-year PhD
students in Johns Hopkins University Department of Civil and Systems Engineering （Systems Track）) 

Previously, I received the B.Eng. degree in Microelectronics Science and Engineering from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/), in 2023, and M. Sci. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

My current research interests primarily focuses on two key areas:

* Sustainability of large language models:
1) Energy- and carbon-aware AI infrastructure and deployment strategies.
2) Cost-aware modeling, scheduling, and deployment of large language models.
*  Edge AI computation systems:
1) Optimal multi-model and expert ensemble systems for resource-constrained environments.
2) Accuracy–efficiency co-optimization under latency, energy, and hardware constraints.
3) End-to-end algorithm–hardware co-design across the full edge AI stack.
